How Web Works Exercise

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
	Hypertext transfer protocol is a way to exchange information over the web.
- What is a URL?
	URL is a address or location for a specific website or resource.
- What is DNS?
	Domain Name System converts hostnames to numeric IP addresses, which allows users to find websites through URLs. 
- What is a query string?
	A query string can be found at the end of an URL, which specifies search parameters within a website.
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
	Two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. GET is used to retrieve information from a server, while POST is used to make changes to a server.
- What is an HTTP request?
	An HTTP request occurs when a user request information from a server.
- What is an HTTP response?
	An HTTP response occurs once a server receives a request and provides an action based on the request. 
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
	An HTTP header is additional or relavent information relating to a server request. URL and languages are request headers, while content information are response headers.
- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
	The hostname(somesite.com) will be converted to an IP address through DNS, and a request will be sent to the server once it's been located. 
	If not found, a status page will generate based on a corresponding code (404).
	A response will be provided based on the resource(/some/page.html) that specifies what a user is looking for.
